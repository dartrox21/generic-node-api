GET {{URL}}/auth/login
The valid token is returned in the headers

###### POSTMAN TIP
In your LOGIN request in the section of `Tests` you can add the following code to get the token and set it as a global variable so you can access it easier in other requests
`
const token = pm.response.headers.get("Authorization");
if(token !== undefined && token !== null ) {
    pm.globals.set("TOKEN", token);
}
`
